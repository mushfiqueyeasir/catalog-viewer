    description:
      "The Sahara is the world’s largest hot desert covering most of Northern Africa, making it almost as large as the United States. Contrary to popular belief, large sand dunes (called ergs) form only a minor part of the Sahara. Most of the desert consists of largely barren, hard, rocky plateaus, with very little sand. The Sahara receives less than three inches of rain a year on average. Even in the Sahara’s wettest areas, it may rain only twice a week and not rain again for years.",

    description:
      "Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on the planet, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. Although about 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice, it is technically a desert (the largest on earth) with very little precipitation.    Antarctica is colder than the Arctic because much of the continent is more than 3 kilometers (2 miles) above sea level, and because the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone transferring the ocean’s relative warmth through the icepack. Sea life of Antarctica include penguins, blue whales, orcas, and seals.",

Booking a Galapagos Islands cruise with a company in your home country is usually the most convenient, but is often more expensive. There are also a lot of companies that can book tours either in Puerto Ayora or from Guayaquil or Quito.",
